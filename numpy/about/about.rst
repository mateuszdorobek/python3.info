Numpy
=====


NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.


Important
---------
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

    * a powerful N-dimensional array object
    * sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
    * tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
    * useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
