    CPU
    Central Processing Unit
        A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor,
        main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry within
        a computer that executes instructions that make up a computer
        program. [#WikipediaCPU]_

    GPU
    Graphics Processing Unit
        A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit
        designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the
        creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display
        device. [#WikipediaGPU]_

    ALU
    Arithmetic Logic Unit
        An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic
        circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer
        binary numbers. [#WikipediaALU]_

    FPU
    Floating-Point Unit
        A floating-point unit (FPU, colloquially a math coprocessor) is a
        part of a computer system specially designed to carry out operations
        on floating-point numbers. [#WikipediaFPU]_

    TPU
    Tensor Processing Unit
        A tensor processing unit (TPU) is an AI accelerator
        application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by Google
        specifically for neural network machine learning, particularly using
        Google's own TensorFlow software. [#WikipediaTPU]_
