GET
---
Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect.


POST
----
The POST method requests that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the web resource identified by the URI.


PUT
---
The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied URI.


PATCH
-----
The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.


DELETE
------
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.


HEAD
----
The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body.


CONNECT
-------
The CONNECT method converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, usually to facilitate SSL-encrypted communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted HTTP proxy.


OPTIONS
-------
The OPTIONS method returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified URL.


TRACE
-----
The TRACE method echoes the received request so that a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers.
