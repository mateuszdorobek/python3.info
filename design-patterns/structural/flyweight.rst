Problem
-------
* Imagine mapping application, such as: Open Street Maps, Google Maps, Yelp, Trip Advisor etc.

* Icons can take a lot of memory, times number of points on the map
* It might crash with out of memory error (especially on mobile devices)

Solution
--------
* Separate the data you want to share from other data
* Pattern will create a dict with point type and its icon
* It will reuse icon for each type
* So it will prevent from storing duplicated data in memory
