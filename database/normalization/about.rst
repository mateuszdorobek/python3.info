Normalization About
===================
* Entities - rows in database
* Attributes - columns in database
* Normalization is what gives data meaning
* NF - Normal Form
* In order to be in 3rd normal form, you need to be in 1st and 2nd NF
* Core basics: 1st, 2nd, 3rd
* Exceptions: 4th, 5th
* 1st: atomic values, unique identifiers (PK), columns with same type
* 2nd: all data must depend on the Primary Key
* 3rd: PK define all Non-Key columns, those can't depend on any other Key
* 4th: No multi-valued dependencies

    normalization
        Database normalization is the process of structuring a database,
        usually a relational database, in accordance with a series of
        so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and
        improve data integrity. Normalization entails organizing the columns
        (attributes) and tables (relations) of a database to ensure that
        their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity
        constraints. It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either
        by a process of synthesis (creating a new database design) or
        decomposition (improving an existing database design). A relational
        database relation is often described as 'normalized' if it meets
        third normal form. [#WikipediaDatabaseNormalization]_ [#Codd1972]_
