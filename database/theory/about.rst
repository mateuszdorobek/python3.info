Big Data

        Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically
        extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are
        too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing
        application software. Data with many fields (columns) offer greater
        statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more
        attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.
        Big data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage,
        data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying,
        updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was
        originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and
        velocity. The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling,
        and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling.
        Therefore, big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the
        capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable
        time and value. [#WikipediaBigData]_
