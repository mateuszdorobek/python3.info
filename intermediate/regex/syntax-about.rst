>>> print('hello\nworld')
hello
world

Linefeed means to advance downward to the next line; however, it has been
repurposed and renamed. Used as "newline", it terminates lines (commonly
confused with separating lines). This is commonly escaped as \n,
abbreviated LF or NL, and has ASCII value 10 or 0x0A. CRLF (but not CRNL)
is used for the pair \r\n [#stackFF]_.

>>> print('hello\r\nworld')  # doctest: +SKIP
hello
world

Carriage return means to return to the beginning of the current line
without advancing downward. The name comes from a printer's carriage, as
monitors were rare when the name was coined. This is commonly escaped as
\r, abbreviated CR, and has ASCII value 13 or 0x0D [#stackFF]_.

>>> print('hello\rworld')  # doctest: +SKIP
world

The most common difference (and probably the only one worth worrying
about) is lines end with CRLF on Windows, NL on Unix-likes, and CR on
older Macs (the situation has changed with OS X to be like Unix). Note the
shift in meaning from LF to NL, for the exact same character, gives the
differences between Windows and Unix. (Windows is, of course, newer than
Unix, so it didn't adopt this semantic shift. That probably came from the
Apple II using CR. CR was common on other 8-bit systems, too, like the
Commodore and Tandy. ASCII wasn't universal on these systems: Commodore
used PETSCII, which had LF at 0x8d (!). Atari had no LF character at all.
For whatever reason, CR = 0x0d was more-or-less standard. Many text
editors can read files in any of these three formats and convert between
them, but not all utilities can [#stackFF]_.

>>> print('hello\bworld')  # doctest: +SKIP
hellworld

\b is a nondestructive backspace. It moves the cursor backward, but
doesn't erase what's there. Then following output overwrites the previous.

>>> print('hello\sworld')  # doctest: +SKIP
hello\sworld

>>> print('hello\tworld')  # doctest: +SKIP
hello	world

Form feed means advance downward to the next "page". It was commonly used
as page separators, but now is also used as section separators. (It's
uncommonly used in source code to divide logically independent functions
or groups of functions.) Text editors can use this character when you
"insert a page break". This is commonly escaped as \f, abbreviated FF, and
has ASCII value 12 or 0x0C [#stackFF]_.

>>> print('hello\fworld')  # doctest: +SKIP
helloworld

Form feed is a bit more interesting (even though less commonly used
directly), and with the usual definition of page separator, it can only
come between lines (e.g. after the newline sequence of NL, CRLF, or CR) or
at the start or end of the file [#stackFF]_.

Vertical tab was used to speed up printer vertical movement. Some printers
used special tab belts with various tab spots. This helped align content
on forms. VT to header space, fill in header, VT to body area, fill in
lines, VT to form footer. Generally it was coded in the program as a
character constant. From the keyboard, it would be CTRL-K. It is hardly
used any more. Most forms are generated in a printer control language like
postscript [#stackVT1]_.

>>> print('hello\vworld')  # doctest: +SKIP
hello
     world

The above output appears to result in the default vertical size being one
line. This could be used to do line feed without a carriage return on
devices with convert linefeed to carriage-return + linefeed [#stackVT1]_.

Microsoft Word uses VT as a line separator in order to distinguish it from
the normal new line function, which is used as a paragraph separator
[#stackVT2]_.


Raw Strings
-----------
* Recap information about raw strings ``r'...'``

>>> print('hello\nworld')
hello
world

>>> print('hello\\nworld')
hello\nworld

>>> print(r'hello\nworld')
hello\nworld

Example:

>>> print('\btodo\b')  # doctest: +SKIP
todo
>>>
>>> print(r'\btodo\b')
\btodo\b


ASCII vs Unicode
----------------
* ``re.UNICODE``
* ``re.ASCII``
* ASCII for letters in latin alphabet
* UNICODE includes diacritics and accent characters (ąśćłóźć, etc.)

>>> import string
>>>
>>>
>>> string.ascii_lowercase
'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
>>>
>>> string.ascii_uppercase
'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
>>>
>>> string.ascii_letters
'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'

>>> import unicodedata
>>>
>>>
>>> unicodedata.name('a')
'LATIN SMALL LETTER A'
>>>
>>> unicodedata.name('ą')
'LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH OGONEK'
>>>
>>> unicodedata.name('ś')
'LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH ACUTE'
>>>
>>> unicodedata.name('ł')
'LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH STROKE'
>>>
>>> unicodedata.name('ż')
'LATIN SMALL LETTER Z WITH DOT ABOVE'
>>>

>>> print('\U0001F680')
🚀

>>> import unicodedata
>>>
>>>
>>> a = '\U0001F9D1'  # 🧑
>>> b = '\U0000200D'  # ''
>>> c = '\U0001F680'  # 🚀
>>>
>>> astronaut = a + b + c
>>> print(astronaut)
🧑‍🚀
>>>
>>> unicodedata.name(a)
'ADULT'
>>>
>>> unicodedata.name(b)
'ZERO WIDTH JOINER'
>>>
>>> unicodedata.name(c)
'ROCKET'
>>>
>>> unicodedata.name(astronaut)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: name() argument 1 must be a unicode character, not str


Digit, Hexadecimal, Octal
-------------------------
>>> import string
>>>
>>>
>>> string.digits
'0123456789'
>>>
>>> string.hexdigits
'0123456789abcdefABCDEF'
>>>
>>> string.octdigits
'01234567'


Punctuation
-----------
>>> import string
>>>
>>>
>>> string.punctuation
'!"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~'
>>>
>>> string.printable
'0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~ \t\n\r\x0b\x0c'
