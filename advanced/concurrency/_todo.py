import asyncio

loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()



Return the running event loop in the current OS thread.

If there is no running event loop a RuntimeError is raised. This function can only be called from a coroutine or a callback.


loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_forever()

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.sleep(3))

     print(datetime.now())

loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.sleep(3))

# loop.run_until_complete(future)
#   Run until the future (an instance of Future) has completed.
#
# loop.run_forever()
#   Run the event loop until stop() is called.
#
# loop.stop()
#   Stop the event loop.
#
# loop.is_running()
#   Return True if the event loop is currently running.
#
# loop.is_closed()
#   Return True if the event loop was closed.
#
# loop.close()
#   Close the event loop.


# loop.call_soon(callback, *args, context=None)
#   Schedule the callback callback to be called with args arguments at the
# next iteration of the event loop. This method is not thread-safe.
#
# loop.call_soon_threadsafe(callback, *args, context=None)
#   A thread-safe variant of call_soon(). Must be used to schedule callbacks
# from another thread.


# loop.call_later(delay, callback, *args, context=None)
#   Schedule callback to be called after the given delay number of seconds (
# can be either an int or a float).
#
# loop.call_at(when, callback, *args, context=None)
#   Schedule callback to be called at the given absolute timestamp when (an
# int or a float), using the same time reference as loop.time().
#
# loop.time()
#   Return the current time, as a float value, according to the event loopâ€™s
# internal monotonic clock.
