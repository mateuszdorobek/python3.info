FuncProg About
==============
* Programming paradigm
* Programs are constructed by applying and composing functions
* Functions are treated as first-class citizens
* Functional programming avoids side effects
* Functional programming provides referential transparency
* Instead of loop use ``map`` and recurrence
* Functions can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed
  as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data
  type can [#WikipediaFunc]_
* Imperative program will use a loop to traverse and modify a list, while
  a functional program, would prefer using a higher-order ``map`` function
  that takes a function and a list, generating and returning a new list by
  applying the function to each list item [#Spiewak2008]_
* Restricting side effects, can decrease number of bugs, be easier to
  debug and test, and be more suited to formal verification [#Hughes1984]_
