---------
* Programming paradigm
* Programs are constructed by applying and composing functions
* Functions are treated as first-class citizens

* Functions can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed
  as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data
  type can [#WikipediaFunc]_

* Functional programming avoids side effects, which are used in imperative
  programming to implement state and I/O

* Pure functional programming completely prevents side-effects and
  provides referential transparency

* Higher-order functions are rarely used in older imperative programming.

* Imperative program will use a loop to traverse and modify a list, while
  a functional program, would prefer using a higher-order ``map`` function
  that takes a function and a list, generating and returning a new list by
  applying the function to each list item [#Spiewak2008]_

* Restricting side effects, can decrease number of bugs, be easier to
  debug and test, and be more suited to formal verification [#Hughes1984]_
  [#Hudak1989]_

* Functional programming languages are typically less efficient in their
  use of CPU and memory than imperative languages such as C, Java, Python
  [#Paulson1996]_

* This is due that some mutable data structures like arrays have a very
  straightforward implementation using present hardware
