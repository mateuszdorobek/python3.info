FuncProg Recurrence
===================


.. epigraph::

    Aby zrozumieć rekurencję – musisz najpierw zrozumieć rekurencję.


Important
---------
* Also known as recursion
* Iteration in functional languages is usually accomplished via recursion
* Recursive functions invoke themselves
* Operation is repeated until it reaches the base case
* In general, recursion requires maintaining a stack, which consumes space
  in a linear amount to the depth of recursion.
* This could make recursion prohibitively expensive to use instead of
  imperative loops.
* However, a special form of recursion known as tail recursion can be
  recognized and optimized by a compiler into the same code used to
  implement iteration in imperative languages.
* Tail recursion optimization can be implemented by transforming the
  program into continuation passing style during compiling, among other
  approaches. [#WikipediaFunc]_


Recurrence in Python
--------------------
* Python isn't a functional language
* CPython implementation doesn't optimize tail recursion
* Tail recursion is not a particularly efficient technique in Python
* Uncontrolled recursion causes stack overflows!
* Rewriting the algorithm iteratively, is generally a better idea


Example
-------
Recap information about factorial (``n!``):

.. code-block:: text

    5! = 5 * 4!
    4! = 4 * 3!
    3! = 3 * 2!
    2! = 2 * 1!
    1! = 1 * 0!
    0! = 1

.. code-block:: text

    n! = n * (n-1)!  # 0! = 1

>>> def factorial(n):
...     if n == 0:
...         return 1
...     else:
...         return n * factorial(n-1)

.. code-block:: python

    factorial(5)                                    # = 120
        return 5 * factorial(4)                     # 5 * 24 = 120
            return 4 * factorial(3)                 # 4 * 6 = 24
                return 3 * factorial(2)             # 3 * 2 = 6
                    return 2 * factorial(1)         # 2 * 1 = 2
                        return 1 * factorial(0)     # 1 * 1 = 1
                            return 1                # 1


Recursion Depth Limit
---------------------
* Default recursion depth limit is 1000
* Warning: Anaconda sets default recursion depth limit to 2000

>>> import sys
>>>
>>> sys.setrecursionlimit(3000)
