FuncProg Referential Transparency
=================================
* Value of a variable in a functional program never changes once defined
* This eliminates any chances of side effects
* Any variable can be replaced with its actual value at any point of execution [#Hughes1984]_


Variables, once defined in a functional programming language, arenâ€™t allowed to change the value that they hold. This is known as referential transparency. It ensures that the same language expression gives the same output. [#Inouye2022]_

Assignment statements are discouraged in functional programming. For storing additional values in a program developed using the functional paradigm, new variables must be defined. The state of a variable in such a program is constant at any moment in time. [#Inouye2022]_

Referential transparency eliminates the slightest chances of any undesired effects, as any variable can be replaced with its actual value at any point during the program execution. [#Inouye2022]_

Bad:

>>> a = 1
>>> a += 2

Good:

>>> a = 1
>>> b = a + 2


Use Case - 0x01
---------------
>>> def add(a,b):
...     return a + b
>>>
>>>
>>> x = 1
>>> y = 2
>>>
>>> add(x,y)
3
>>> add(1,y)
3
>>> add(x,2)
3
>>> add(1,2)
3
