Computational Complexity
------------------------


Memory Complexity
-----------------


Cognitive Complexity
--------------------
* Measure of how difficult the application is to understand
* Measure of how hard the control flow of a function is to understand
* Functions with high Cognitive Complexity will be difficult to maintain.
* https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf


Cyclomatic Complexity
---------------------
* Measures the minimum number of test cases required for full test coverage.


Big O notation
--------------
Most common:

    * O(sqrt_n)
    * O(log_n)
    * O(log2_n)
    * O(1)
    * O(n)
    * O(nlog2_n)
    * O(n^2)
    * O(2^n)
    * O(n!)
