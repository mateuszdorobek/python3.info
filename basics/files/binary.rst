Files Binary
============
* Text I/O over a binary storage (such as a file) is significantly slower
  than binary I/O over the same storage
* It requires conversions between unicode and binary data using
  a character codec
* This can become noticeable handling huge amounts of text data like
  large log files
* Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#id3


Append Binary
-------------
* ``mode='ab'`` - append in binary mode

>>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.bin'
>>> DATA = 'We choose to go to the Moon...'
>>> data = DATA.encode()
>>>
>>> with open(FILE, mode='ab') as file:
...     file.write(data)
30


Write Binary
------------
* ``mode='wb'`` - write in binary mode

>>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.bin'
>>> DATA = 'We choose to go to the Moon...'
>>> data = DATA.encode()
>>>
>>> with open(FILE, mode='wb') as file:
...     file.write(data)
30


Read Binary
-----------
* ``mode='rb'`` - read in binary mode

>>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.bin'
>>>
>>> with open(FILE, mode='rb') as file:
...     data = file.read()
...
>>> result = data.decode()
>>> print(result)
We choose to go to the Moon...


Pickle
------
* Works with any Python object (variables, functions, classes, nested objects)
* More information in `Serialization Pickle`

Write binary data to file:

>>> import pickle
>>>
>>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.pkl'
>>> data = [1, 2, 3]
>>>
>>> with open(FILE, mode='wb') as file:
...     pickle.dump(data, file)

Load binary data from file:

>>> import pickle
>>>
>>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.pkl'
>>>
>>> with open(FILE, mode='rb') as file:
...     result = pickle.load(file)
...
>>> print(result)
[1, 2, 3]

Seek
----
* Go to the n-th byte in the file
* Supports negative index (from end of file)

>>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.bin'
>>> DATA = b'We choose to go to the Moon...'
>>>
>>>
>>> with open(FILE, mode='wb') as file:
...     file.write(DATA)
30
>>>
>>> file = open(FILE, mode='rb')
>>>
>>> file.seek(23)
23
>>> file.read(1)
b'M'
>>> file.read(1)
b'o'
>>> file.read(1)
b'o'
>>> file.read(1)
b'n'
>>>
>>> file.seek(23)
23
>>> file.read(4)
b'Moon'
>>>
>>> file.seek(-7, 2)
23
>>> file.read(4)
b'Moon'
