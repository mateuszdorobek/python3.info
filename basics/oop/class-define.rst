    class
        Templates for objects.


Classes
-------
* Classes are templates for objects

Classes should have capitalized name:

>>> class Astronaut:
...     pass


Class Names
-----------
* ``PascalCase`` name convention
Multi-word class names should use ``PascalCase``:

>>> class SeniorAstronaut:
...     pass


Good Practices
--------------
* Never print in a class
* All classes in one file - when classes are short
* One class per file - when classes are long

You can mix classes and functions in one file:

>>> def say_hello():
...     pass
>>>
>>>
>>> class Astronaut:
...     pass


Use Case - 0x01
---------------
>>> class AstronautEngineer:
...     pass
>>>
>>>
>>> class AstronautScientist:
...     pass
>>>
>>>
>>> class AstronautPilot:
...     pass
