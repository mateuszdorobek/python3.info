    function
    func
    fn
        A set of instructions which has common name. Function will execute all of
        those instructions each time it is called.

    call
    function call
    call a function
        Run a function.

    procedure
        The same as function. Way back in history there was a distinction that
        the procedures don't take an arguments and functions does. Now this
        blurred completely. Hardly anyone is talking about procedures now, so the
        same stuck, but it is very rarely used. Most common old-school programmers
        whill use that word. You may find this also in documentation of aged
        projects.


Syntax
------
.. code-block:: python

    def <name>():
        <do something>


Example
-------
>>> def say_hello():
...     print('hello')

If the function is short, you can also write it in the one line. This is not
recommended and degrades code readability:

>>> def say_hello(): print('hello')


Calling
-------
Let's define a function:

>>> def say_hello():
...     print('hello')

Call a function for a first time:

>>> say_hello()
hello

Call a function for a second time:

>>> say_hello()
hello

Each time it will give the same result. That's right. This function is very
simple and all what it does is just print word 'hello' on the standard output.


Function Name Case
------------------
Do not use ``camelCase`` or ``PascalCase`` names.

The ``camelCase`` name is c/c++/Java/JavaScript convention. It is not good
to mix conventions from different languages. If you write C code, use C
conventions. If you program in Python, use Python conventions. Remember,
there are different communities around both of those languages:

>>> def sayHello():
...     pass

The ``PascalCase`` name has completely different meaning in Python - it is
used for classes. Using such name convention will mistake others.

>>> def SayHello():
...     pass

Use ``snake_case`` names in Python. It is easy to remember. Python looks like
a snake, and sounds like a snake ;) This is double internal joke, because
Python name came from Monty Python, of which Guido van Rossum was a big fun.
The other reference is to duck typing (dynamic typing) - "If it walks like a duck
and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck":

This is ``snake_case()`` name. It is Pythonic way:

>>> def say_hello():
...     pass


Choosing Good Name
------------------
People, especially those who uses simple IDEs or notepads without sophisticated
autocompletion will tend to create function with shorter names in order to save
couple of characters each time when it is called. This at the beginning could
be a good idea, but in the long run will lead to disaster. Coming back to your
code after a year or two will require you to rediscover the code and read it
once again.

>>> def var(data, m):
...     return sum((Xi-m) ** 2 for Xi in data) / len(data)

Function name ``var()`` is very similar to built-in function ``vars()`` which does
something completely different. It shows all the attributes of an object passed
to it. A single misspell, such as forgetting about letter ``s`` at the end of a
name may lead to printing all the internal information about object publicly.
This is very dangerous for publicly accessed systems.

More verbose names, such as ``variance()`` will distinguish this function from
built-in ``vars()`` far better:

>>> def variance(data, m):
...     return sum((Xi-m) ** 2 for Xi in data) / len(data)

This way a probability for mistake is far lower and even if, then will be
better discoverable.


Name Collisions
---------------
Add underscore (``_``) at the end of name when name collide.

>>> def print_(text):
...     print(f'<strong>{text}</strong>')

Although prefer naming it differently:

>>> def print_html(text):
...     print(f'<strong>{text}</strong>')


Special Function Names
----------------------
System functions names starts and ends with 'dunder'. The word 'dunder' stands
for double underscores: ``__``:

>>> def __import__(module_name):
...     pass
