* ADR - Architectural Decision Records

An Architectural Decision (AD) is a justified software design choice
that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is
architecturally significant. An Architecturally Significant Requirement
(ASR) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software system's
architecture and quality. An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures
a single AD and its rationale; the collection of ADRs created and maintained
in a project constitute its decision log. All these are within the topic
of Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM), but ADR usage can be extended
to design and other decisions ("any decision record") [#adrgithub]_.
