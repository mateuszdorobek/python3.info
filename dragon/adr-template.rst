* Public Announcement: 1962-09-12
* Deciders: Mark Watney, Melissa Lewis, Rick Martinez


Context and Problem Statement
-----------------------------
* Before this decade is out
* Landing a man on the moon
* Returning him safely to the Earth


Decision Drivers
----------------
* Demonstrate technological superiority
* Win Space Race between superpowers
* We are doing this for all mankind
* Political reason
* Inspiration for next generation
* Create a great number of new companies, and tens of thousands of new jobs
* Generate new demands in investment and skilled personnel
* Double the number of NASA scientists and engineers
* Increase outlays for salaries and expenses to $60 million a year
* Invest $200 million in plant and laboratory facilities
* Direct or contract for new space efforts over $1 billion


Considered Options
------------------
* Long duration spaceflight to orbital station
* Mars landing
* Doing nothing


Decision Outcome
----------------
* We choose to go to the moon.
* We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things,
  not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal
  will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills,
  because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are
  unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.


Pros and Cons of the Options
----------------------------
Mars landing:

    * Dangerous
    * Requires much bigger budget

Orbital Station:

    * Not spectacular
    * Will not progress us as much as Moon landing
