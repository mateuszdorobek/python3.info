SciPy
=====
SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics,
science, and engineering. It includes modules for statistics, optimization,
integration, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, signal and image processing,
ODE solvers, and more. It is also the name of a very popular conference
on scientific programming with Python.

The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast
N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with
NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical
routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.
Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install,
and are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful
enough to be depended upon by some of the world's leading scientists and
engineers. If you need to manipulate numbers on a computer and display or
publish the results.

SciPy builds on the NumPy array object and is part of the NumPy stack which
includes tools like Matplotlib, pandas and SymPy, and an expanding set of
scientific computing libraries. This NumPy stack has similar users to other
applications such as MATLAB, GNU Octave, and Scilab. The NumPy stack is also
sometimes referred to as the SciPy stack.
